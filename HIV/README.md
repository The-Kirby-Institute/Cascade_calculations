## Australian HIV Cascade Calculations ##

This directory contains all the code and materials used for estimating each step of the Australian HIV diagnosis and care cascade. Annual estimates are reported annually in the HIV, viral hepatitis and sexually transmissible infections in the Australia Annual Surveillance Report (ASR). The HIV cascade is treated as a separate sub-project within the overall Australian cascades project. 

### Aims ###

The aim of the HIV cascade calculations is to estimate the total number of people living with HIV, the total number of people living with diagnosed HIV, the number of people retained in care, the number of people on antiretrovial treatment (ART), and the number of people on treatment with suppressed viral load for each calendar year. The purpose of the cascade is highlight any potential gaps in care and treatment at a cross-sectional population level and to achieve the maximal level of viral suppression. HIV cascades can be estimated for specific populations based on region, sex, demographics, ethnicity, age, and risk of HIV exposure. 

### Project organization ###

All the files related to the HIV cascade estimates and calculations are stored in this directory and 6 sub-directories. Some of these materials are stored locally and are not available from the online repository.
